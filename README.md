# 3D-Solar-System

# Here are five key features about this project:

1. Solar System Animation: The project is an animation of a simplified solar system with three planets orbiting around a central sun. The animation uses CSS keyframes to create the orbits and rotations of the planets.

2. Realistic Planet Render: The project attempts to create a realistic rendering of each planet with a gradient background that simulates the appearance of celestial bodies. Each planet has a smooth transition between two colors as they rotate.

3. Interactive CSS Transformations: CSS is used to apply various transformations like scaling, rotating, and changing z-index to create the illusion of planets moving in orbits. This showcases the power of CSS in creating interactive and visually appealing animations.

4. Dynamic Planet Arrangement: Each planet's position is defined with respect to its container using CSS properties like left and top. This dynamic arrangement allows for different orbits and relative positions, enhancing the realism of the animation.

5. Continuously Looping Animation: The animation is designed to run continuously, with a 12-second loop, giving the appearance of perpetual planetary motion. The use of CSS animations ensures a smooth and seamless transition from one animation phase to the next.
